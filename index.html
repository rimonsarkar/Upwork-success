        I can't even believe that I'm giving you this right now. This has earned me

<p>
    But sending great upwork proposals that get clients, Isn't just about a bag
of tips and tricks that you need to gain all at once. It also isn't about combining
10,000 different tips and tricks so that you magically win jobs, writing 
great upwork proposals is a system. And today i'm gonna break it down for you, 
and we're gonna write a proposal from scratch together. Word for word.

This video is different and longer, very much on purpose, and it will be best if you
give me your attention for the entire video, because not only are we gonna 
write an entire proposal from scratch and go into why some things work 
and some things don't, but i've also been hinting at something for a while 
now on this channel, and it's big, and it;s really important to anyone 
looking go win more clients on upwork. 

And it is finaly here. I'll be offering it to you near the end of this 
video. So I will appreciate it if you stick around untill then, So you can 
understand why I'm so excited about it. let's talk about what I would do if
I wanted to write successful proposals from scratch right now, and this is 
gonna apply wheather you're an experienced freelancer or a total beginner.

</p>
<p>
    So I don't care if you've made a hundred thousand dollars or you're still 
looking for your first client. This is going to apply to you. Sending
proposals on Upwork can be extremly challenging. I know this from experience,
clients might not respond to you. It might take you forever to get an actual
client. And that's a big problem for a lot of people. And if you're ever 
been through that process, You know that its extermly difficult. if you wanna 
be successful on upwork, then you gotta have the skillset to be able to deliver
dynamite proposals Consistently over and over again. If you don't know anything 
about me,.............

Now let's dive right in. Proposals are your lifeblood as a successful freelancer
an awesome proposal means that you never need to look for clients. Cliets will 
just like find you. Writing  a bad proposal consistently means that you 
might never get a single client, and you're just gonna be spinning your
wheels endlessly wondering, "why is this not working?" The number one thing
that you have to do, 
</p>

<p>
    1. You have to break othe barrier.
You have to mentally get over your inability to just send something out.
I struggled with this so much. When I first got strated, I was like, Oh my God!
how are the clients going to think about me when I send them something that
maybe isn't that good or that other freelancer have sent them something that
is just fantastic, and mine is just, you know, kind of in the middle, not that
great. " You have to get out of the mental rabbit hole where you're just spending
all of your thime thinking, "oh my God", How is this not going to work? And
actually flip the script around. If you're beginner on upwork, 
Then the first thing that you have to do is you just have to send 10 proposals 
as a starter. That is your baseline, especially if they're bad, you have to 
do this because you have to get comfortable with the fact that not everything 
is going to work out. 

Even today with as many proposals as I have sent, at least 90% do not get a response.
So be comfortable with the Nos, Understand that that is a fact of life.
But if you are lookin for as many nos as you can possibily get, then you 
have just totally unclocked your ability to just keep sending and sending and 
sending and play that numbers game that is upward and build yourself up 
for the win. 73% of people report that they are overthinking things and it stops
them from doing whast they should actually be doing, which in this case, 
your job: start sending proposals. If you've never sent a proposal before, 
then you've gotta send 10, Wheather they're good, bad, or in between just get 
yourself comfortable with "yeah, I'm going to get the no," because the more 
nos that you get, the more yeses you will have people who are enrolled in 
the freelance MVP profile and proposals academy have been extremly successfully
using an earlier version of this framework.

And the reason why it is so important for me to just get out there and start
sending proposals is because for so many people, this is stops them.
And it's not just because they've never sent a proposal before. It's 
because they get in analysis paralysis. And i mean, this sincerely:
If you were to come to me and say, "hey even, I am just starting on Upwork,"
or evan if you've been on upwork for a little while,"How should i do this? What 
should I do first?" Whatever you know about it, make some proposal, send 
10 of them. because at that point, the conversation that we could have would
be on a whole other level, just once you've gotten a couple of upward proposals
under your belt. Because at that point we can really start taking about what 
will work for your proposals and what directions you can go with then That
will work once we've got that done, then we're gonna go back to the 
whiteboard for step two.

    Now that we've broken the barrier and just gotten started.Now,
